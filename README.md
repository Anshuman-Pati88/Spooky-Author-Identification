# Spooky Author Identification 🕵️‍♂️📜

This project focuses on identifying the author of eerie, spooky text passages using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. Inspired by a Kaggle competition, it uses labeled sentences written by **Edgar Allan Poe**, **Mary Shelley**, and **HP Lovecraft** to train a classification model.
